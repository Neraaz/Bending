For flat ribbon, relax ions along all direction.
For bent ribbon, relax edge metallic atoms only along periodic direction. all other ions are relaxed in all directions.
For both also relax periodic direction.

put kpoint 1 for vacuum direction. and perform convergence tests along length (periodic direction)

Once, we have flat ribbon relaxed, use relax-length.py to calculate width (L0) of relaxed flat nanoribbon.

First do band calculation. save WAVECAR. then use INCAR-charge to calculate band decomposed charge density


for PBE, we can use chargecar and wavecar to read for band structure. add more points with 0 weight.
for SCAN and Hybrid, we can add points with 0 weight after the IBZPOINT in IBZKPOINT. To plot the band, we need to remove few kpoint with non-zero weight.
the kpoint with 0 weight doesn't contribute to the total energy.
